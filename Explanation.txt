You given an array A of integers, for each integer A[i] we need to choose either x = -K or x = K, and add x to A[i] (only once).
After this process, we have some array B.
Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.

Input Description:
First line contains, n and k. n the size of the list. (1<n,k<1000)
Second line contains, n elements of list.

Output Description:
Print the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.

Sample Input:
1 0
1

Sample Output:
0

Explanation:
the array b will be [1] so the output is 0.
